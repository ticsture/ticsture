## About Me

I'm a software engineer passionate about architecting production-grade systems at the intersection of AI, security, and developer experience. My work focuses on building **intelligent platforms** that solve complex problems through clean architecture, thoughtful design, and cutting-edge technology.

Currently exploring **AI safety tooling**, **adaptive security systems**, and **high-performance SaaS platforms**. I thrive in environments where engineering rigor meets rapid innovation.

## Featured Projects

### 🎯 [AI Interview Platform](https://github.com/ticsture/ai-interview-platform)
**Adaptive quiz generation with AI-powered mastery tracking**

An intelligent interview preparation platform that uses LLM-driven quiz generation combined with subtopic mastery analytics. Features include ordered question flows, instant retry workflows for missed concepts, and privacy-first local session storage.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 16 (React 19, App Router) + TypeScript
- Groq AI (llama-3-8b-instruct)
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Express + Mongoose (optional persistence)
- MongoDB Atlas

**Key Features:**
- AI-generated structured quizzes with canonical subtopic ordering
- Real-time coverage tracking and mastery analytics
- Keyboard-driven interface for power users
- Stats dashboard with performance tiers and sparklines
- Focus-only retry system (regenerate only missed subtopics)

**Defensive security testing for untrusted AI models**

Built for the Apart Research Defensive Acceleration Hackathon. AI Mesh enables rapid adversarial testing of untrusted AI models in 10-20 seconds using real-time threat intelligence and AI-powered risk assessment.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 16 + TypeScript
- Groq AI (llama-3.1-8b-instant)
- Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Tailwind CSS

**Key Features:**
- Real-time threat intelligence (r/ChatGPTJailbreak, HackerNews)
- Automatic adversarial prompt generation
- Multi-layer risk assessment (heuristic + AI judge)
- 10-20 second comprehensive security reports
- OpenAI-compatible model registry

**Impact:**
- Bridges gap between threat intelligence and model evaluation
- Enables informed deployment decisions for untrusted models
- Maintains up-to-date awareness of emerging jailbreak techniques
